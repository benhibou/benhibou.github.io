	Hello,
<br />
<br />
On the weekend of February the 11th and 12th 2012 I went to Dresden, Germany 
(
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jYf8zUwNWF41tthH8"> <b> Pictures </b> </a>).

 At about this date every year takes place a concert to remember the 
destruction of the center of the city of Dresden by the Anglo-American
 allied bombing in February the 13th and 14th, 1945. I was not aware of 
this yearly musical event and I wanted to visit the church but I realized
this was not possible on this Saturday evening because of the concert that
 was to take place. I walked away in the freezing cold (~6 to 8 Fahrenheit
 / -14.5 to -13.5 Celsius) on an esplanade overlooking the river Elba and 
made some pictures. Earlier in the afternoon I had visited the 
"Gem&#228ldegalerie Alte Meister" (Old Masters painting gallery) and like the 
young Johann Wolfgang Goethe I could have said: Meine Verwunderung
 &#252berstieg jeden Begriff! (My astonishment was surpassing any 
comprehension). I was transported away by seeing paintings by Rafael,
 Correggio, Veronese, Brueghel, Rubens, Rembrant, ... and most of all by
 Vermeer's "Girl reading a letter by an open window" the live sighting of
 which was the main impulse for my visting Dresden on this weekend. Now I 
was alone in the park and I noticed below a beautiful tree in front of a 
building of modern architecture. In the midst of winter the tree was 
stripped of its leaves but its branches where finely chiseled against one 
of the illuminated white wall of the structure. I thought: "this must be 
the place where they have the exhibit: "Gem&#228ldegalerie Neue Meister" (New Masters painting gallery). I went down a path to make sure of this since I 
wanted to visit this gallery on the following day. I arrived at a bus 
station at the foot of the building and there I saw the bus station was 
named: "Synagoge". I walked further away on a bridge crossing the river
 Elba. From this vantage point I took some pictures of the city center 
while hearing large chunks of ice colliding with each other as they were 
being transported away by the dark waters. How could a Jewish community 
bear to live among the descendants of their torturers? How could Germans 
be reminded every day of the odious crimes their people committed and 
which ended up in the destruction of this city and the death of so many of 
its inhabitants, most of whom innocent victims of a war beyond their will? 
Yet as difficult and terribly painful as it was, there was no way out of 
this reality, but the need to rebuild with inclusion. There was thus no 
way out of the daily remembrance of ones pains and sins. Suddenly I felt 
very lonely over the dark waters, bearing the implications of these 
thoughts for my own humanity. I walked back towards the city center and I
 found myself again on the steps of the Frauenkirche. I decided to 
participate and I purchased a ticket for the evening concert. It turned out to be one of the most intense musical experience I ever lived. The 
"Requiem for Dresden" by the Russian-American composer Lera Auerbach, a 
piece of poignant complexities, dark moods and glimmer of hopes. A piece that accepted a way forward conscious of the mistakes and horrors of the past. Every thing appeared to be included in the music, the ominous
 silence of the beginning, the screams of the sirens, the arrival of the
 bombers, unleashing a destruction of unseen magnitude, the fire, the
 wounded and the dead, the smoke, the pain and the profound sadness, the
 contrite remembrance; the glimmers of hope. Lera Auerbach comes from a 
Jewish family that had to hid their appartenance to this community to 
avoid persecution in Stalin Russia; singing along the chorus part, were 
young boys from the Saint Thomas Choir of boys in New York and St. Paul's 
Cathedral Choir in London together with the "Herren der S&#228chischen 
Staatsopernchores Dresden" and the S&#228chsische Staatskapelle Dresden, musicians and singers being directed by Vladimir Jurowski

An unforgettable musical event in a place of wonderful acoustic at the
 heart of a city charged with history. The Florence of the North it was
 then called. After its destruction although most of the paintings 
collection had long been secured and were spared, one could still ask the question of an art, of a defined beauty that had been claimed by the 
powerful of a civilization that led to persecution, then to destruction 
without a military purpose, mainly for revenge. To set a precedent. When 
the last note of the requiem was played there was no applause whatsoever 
but everyone, musicians, singers and attendees stood up for minute of 
silence that felt like the terrible weigh of all the unjustified dead and
 the conscience that we may carry part of their unfinished lives with some 
hope in our own.
<br />
<br />
And there is Johannes Vermeer example to draw upon. "Girl reading a letter 
by an open window". I came to see in person that painting and I found it. 
When art reaches Vermeer, its purpose is not to define beauty as an 
unreachable aesthetics growing out of darkness. The mythological 
inspiration has given way to the acceptance of what is revealed by light. 
There is still puzzlement at our own human situation. In this particular 
painting, "Girl reading a letter by an open window", while she reads a 
letter we get a sense that the Girl is looking for something. Her attitude 
is one of research; her head angled forward delicately, brings the golden 
lock of hair in front of her left ear. This pose connects with her 
slightly worried expression. The accent of the painting is not placed in 
what she may find, but on the depiction of her attitude and what makes it 
possible. First and for most light allows. In darkness one cannot look for 
something. The light reveals objects and in my personal interpretation one 
can find in this painting the "objects" that sustain the attitude of the
 "Girl". On the rug laying on the table, left of the fruit bowl, one can 
see two masks, mortuary or not, with deep ocular orbits; this would 
represent the ancestry of the Girl, the culture that nurtured her, and 
which has taught her to perceive a number objects, useful for her bodily 
or spiritual sustenance. The red curtain held above the window give the 
impression of an ethereal being, abstract emotion and spirit of smooth lines which finds an embodiment in the "Girl". As a matter of fact I see the part of the curtain behind the window as a women's face that almost 
touches the forehead of the reflection of the "Girl" in the windowpane. And so forth and so on. I see many more faces and spirits, emotions and 
reflections. In the end this painting is a perfect rendering of our human 
situation, able to look for something from the objects we can already 
define through light but well aware that something is missing even though 
we are not really able to tell what. Even if we could we know that this 
will just bring another object into the light of things, perhaps inducing 
some rearrangement among the former ones but the quest will still have to keep going and we shall still have to keep looking for the way. Wasn't Lao
 Tseu saying something of that sort? Telling that the importance was in 
the way, the path, not in the goal. Forcing a definition of a goal would 
make violence to life. This is life in its reality.
<br />
<br />
I came to see "Girl reading by an open window" of Johannes Vermeer. I 
found it. I saw it. I read it in my own way. Now the whole process could 
be reflected on itself: are you sure? You saw it? Hmmmh! Did you? The way 
...

<br />
With best regards,
