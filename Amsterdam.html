	Hello,
<br />
<br />
(
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/UdyVnM2NTEwsVJNz9"> <b> Pictures </b> </a>).
Last Sunday I visited Amsterdam. Two weeks before it was Dresden. This had been a
momentous experience for me and I was weary that Amsterdam would water down my
memories of Dresden. Recently I wrote about my perception of "the way" in Lao Tzeu's
mode after seeing in the "Gemälde Galerie Alte Meister" in Dresden the painting by
Vermeer: "Girl reading a letter by an open window". I discovered there something
tangible, solid, something onto which I could count on, definitely then something very
un-way like but isn't this typically human to try to protect what one has earned the hard
way. Would Amsterdam mollifies this feeling? Yet what would I be doing in Bochum the
whole Sunday? I could still go to Düsseldorf but my routine of Münster on Saturday to
Düsseldorf on Sunday was becoming a bit old. Reluctantly I took a train ticket to
Amsterdam and even more reluctantly bought online a ticket for the Van Gogh
Museum. I had read on the internet that one could bypass likewise the long lines at the
entrance to the museum. It turned out to be true since when I showed up in front of it,
the line to buy a ticket probably amounted to half an hour to one hour waiting time.
Inside the museum the visitor inner thermometer may rise a little more when he learn he
will have to stay in line some more, for about 10 minutes twice, first to deposit his
backpack at the cloakroom then to go through security like at an airport. The joy of art
viewing in the modern times. To reach Amsterdam from Bochum one has to cut across
the thick German and Dutch wilderness of factories, small towns, tall industrial chimneys
puffing and smoking, and even in the middle of all this a few farm fields here and there.
One wonders how on Earth it is possible to dig out so much soil, to pour so much
concrete to build the world in this state; one pities when one see small and dark ponds
of nasty choking water barely sticking out their neck from the little holes they are
confined in. I pondered about this sitting in a train that needed a long track of iron railings
to cut across the landscape and I reached Amsterdam after all, "goede dag"
Amsterdam! I walked quickly through the old city center towards the two museums I
wanted to visit: the Rijksmuseum and then the Van Gogh museum. The Rijskmuseum
is currently being renovated but its "masterpieces" have been temporarily assembled in
a few rooms. A blessing for the profane visitor. Likewise he does not have to make a
"Le Louvre" like visit, half running, half fainting, left lost and breathless among an
overwhelming number of art pieces. Just a few rooms to enjoy calmly. I'll come back to it
later on since I already had my ticket for Van Gogh. Unconsciously probably I wanted to
reserve the feeling of security that the viewing of the classical masters should provide, to
counterbalance the more disturbing one that Van Gogh paintings may impress on me.
As a boy the teacher in a painting class I attended, asked us to copy "Starry night" from
Van Gogh and I really enjoyed doing it, I really felt the painting from within. I was also
fairly satisfied with the result. Later on though, after learning about the life Van Gogh
had, I was perturbed by the fact that I could be attracted by the work of a man who did
not end up being a model of happiness and psychological stability.
When I arrived at the museum door however, I am reassured that I am definitely not the
only one feeling this attraction! Quickly I scan the rooms in the museum glancing at the
paintings from afar through several rows of heads, breathing a thick air, filled with all
kinds of viruses and bacterias that the many nose blowers and mouth coughers in
attendance are sending away on their own. Slowly however the paintings are making
an effect on me and I start with more calm and concentration a second round of
viewing, jumping closer to the paintings when the motion of the crowd creates an
opening. Likewise I let myself being impregnated by the work of the artists. As Van
Gogh is not the only one to be on display, but also are Gauguin, Monet, Redon, Munch,
Hodler, ... Van Gogh style of painting is really unique. The many brush strokes he uses
and which oscillates across the extent of the canvas. It is as if he has integrated motion
and therefore time into the rendering of space. One can see the motion that life has
imparted to a tree through its shape and the wheat in the fields balancing under a hot
august wind, one can perceive the stars moving across the sky and notice the emotions
on the face of the people he portrayed, or the sower walking, throwing the new seeds in
the now plowed up field. In "Landscape at twilight" the colors can attract you like a
strong magnet as if they wanted you to be part of the canvas, in "Wheatfield with crows"
the wavelike motion is so strong that it threatens to destroy all that want to stand still. I
am won over.
<br />
At the Rijksmuseum I found the masterpieces as beautiful as they have always been
described. Many by Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn, a man of great artistry
expressed through the most precise, delicate and patient craftsmanship. Exquisite. One
could stand for a long while just watching the variety of expressions in the gazes that
emanates from the men portrayed in the "The Syndics of the Draper's Guild". How not
be in awe in front of the "Nightwatch", a real tour de force by its size, its details, its
humanity on display in each of the many faces that are rendered on the canvas. In a
room adjacent Pieter de Hooch let us witness the calm flow of common life in the
Netherlands in the 17th century, together with two Vermeer that are currently on display
(out of four). The "Milkmaid" is one of them and again it leaves a very strong impression
on me. Contrary to the "Girl reading a letter at an open window" the light in the room
does not suggest that the objects assembled in the room are illuminated to serve as
support for the understanding of some symbols in a letter, that create or translate a
world that calmly seeks to go beyond. In the "Milkmaid" the light directly falls on the
forehead and the breast of the women to make us feel that this luminous experience is
transmitted with no restraint from head to heart, for her arms and her hands to perform
lovingly a gesture that is mostly directed to sustaining life without which nothing further
can be sought. The Milkmaid is preparing a dish? For a later meal?
In front of such a perfection one can ask what is the necessity and the drive for Van
Gogh to paint? In Vermeer we can sense the absolute truth. If motion is present it is
through the soft glistening of light. We perceive that the milk is flowing from the jar as the
loving gesture of the Milkmaid wanted it to be. Van Gogh includes motion from within,
and flow, and time, as the driving force of what is otherwise a still picture. In this manner
we can appreciate that our perceptions and our judgements are only secondary to life in
motion. They will always, sooner or later, be left in the dust of life's constant flow.
Including these words. The way!
<br />
<br />
Best wishes,
<br />
<br />
