</div> 
    </div>

    <div id="main">
      <h1>What do you mean by "mean"</h1>
      <p>
	As a small boy I did not speak much. Indeed my maternal Grandfather had
        nicknamed me "La carpe", for in French we say "muet comme une carpe" which
        translates literally to "dumb like a carp" and figuratively to "does not say a word". 
        I have always been dumbfounded by the way some people talks, talks, talks, ... as if they 
        feel compelled to populate the emptiness by a symbolic maze so as to feel reassured that they
	belong to something. Personally I am one, more relying on silence and concentration, in order to keep 
        my body in the listening state required to adopt the right balance between pose and motion, 
	which in turn allows to espouse rather than define. In a way I possess an inner confidence
	inscribed in my body that is not demanding further explanations. I have the feeling that my head belongs
	to the void we call space, but for a few pale colors and therefore, what is there to talk about? Let us just
	enjoy the views, making sure we stand in equilibrium, on our two feet. In short I am a simply minded person.
	I reckon as well that to benefit from such a perspective is a blessing life has offered me, in that it tells of the 
	easiness with which I can perform my daily chores without thinking too much about it. This situation
	does not appear to be prevalent for many of us and therefore another type people has developed a capacity to
	express in words a number of mental constructions, to help them plan in advance the actions to be taken or simply
	to create a world inside which they feel more at ease. By doing so these elaborated minds have put forth
	the notion of meaning. Now everyone is suppose to know what meaning is but if you ask yourself what does "to mean" mean
	you may become slightly uncomfortable, for such a question needs to use the very term it wants to define. Thus it can
	only be without further explanation. If we restrict ourself to the two pools of people I described, it thus appear that
	  there is some sort of a uncompatibility. On the one hand there are people who take the
	world for granted and pretend they would do away with any type of explanations. The existence of 
	the other group poses a problem to them since they must either ignore their way of being
	or convert to it in order to be able to communicate with them.
	On the other hand the other group does acknowledge an external world, but one that has to be expressed into words before
	anything else can take place. Then they have to live with a notion of meaning which necessarily "is" and cannot be defined. 
	At this point the separation in two groups become very relative and it represents more of an arbitrary choice as to 
	where one places the boundaries. As is the case with any theory that wish to speak generally about things, where can
	we classify the person who wrote this very paragraph that has just been read. Is he a person who is and lives
	a life of its own or is he rather someone who needs other words to tell and explain, sentences to find what 
	kind of interpretations or meanings can be read into things? 
	Obviously in the latter case the process is subject to be induced in stage, at which point one may ask if we should stop
	if one is to say something about anything? Even about the process itself? For a preliminary sketch of what
	a research project on this matter could look like, with connection to the foundations of quantum mechanichs I shall refer
	the reader to this: <a class="link2" href="B_Boulat_draft.pdf">Research_Draft</a>.
	 <br />
	<br />
	On each side of this page I have placed the pictures of some human beings who
	achieved a lot. Hovering over each thumbnail gives an opportunity to the reader
	to see a larger version of the image as well as to access an external link providing more information 
	about the life and achievement of the personality represented.
	I explain below with just a few sentences how a particular aspect of the work of these individuals has influenced me.  
	In no way this can be interpreted to indicate that I have "understood" them or that I can even grasp some of their 
	viewpoints, attitudes or expressions. I am just acknowledging the effect I perceived they had
	in some way or another on me and thus, as it appears to be at its core, on the matter I addressed in the previous paragraph
	<br />
	<br />
	Cardinal de Richelieu was someone who rose in the darkest of times,
	from modest circumstances to almost absolute power, with intelligence and cunningness but always 
	to serve with integrity the idea of the modern state he had in mind. A state that would serve
	a larger number of its people by restraining but not crushing the power of local despots or the extent of
	sectarisms. 
	Some reason emerged from a dark and tumultuous background, with no real explanations. Newton,
	Einstein and for good reasons the much less known Piron (my Ph.D. advisor) were people who claimed to have
	discovered things as they are, with no further ado. In some way the simplicity and subsequent power of these
	people's theories are stunning. It tells us that the apparent complexity of things
	may only be a false assumption, reserved for the simple mind to get lost or to obey!
      </p>
	<p>Herr Mozart creativity, musical notes flowing from his being to form a piece,
        like drops of water making a torrent in the Alps. Connected to the Earth but at the same time detached from it,
	rising to reach for the aerial space but in an elegant motion through gravity swirling back down to the ground.
	Marcel Proust. Analyzing. The details, the minute, giving a sense to the notion of time,
	unveiling the structures which little by little are left by its passage, until death freezes it. The eternal flow
	engraves the motionless, etching and stretching it into the material until it snaps before being forgotten. 
 	With J.S. Bach a tender light enters the room, the eyes warm up to the music as it travels from the ears to the brain. 
	Soft beams are lifting the weigh from the daily chores. Sliding underneath them they invite to get closer to their
	source, offering to follow the bend of their scattered luminosity.
	</p>
	<p>David Hilbert proposes to generate the world through a machine. A few symbols, axioms and rules of inference
	and you have it. A machine churns it out for you. Kurt G&oumlaut;del, nicknamed <em>Herr Warum</em> by his parents, 
	slashes this dream.
	Or would it have been a nightmare? Could it have told what does "to mean" possibly means? Shostakovich may have had
	the answer, as he escaped narrowly the trap. How come said Stalin you are not giving us an answer? But I do Sir, I do.
	Listen carefully and you will definitely hear it.
	</p>
	<p>Niels Bohr does not get caught. Humble he accepts, the boundaries of our words set up by the results of finite
	experimental procedures. James Joyce report on them, carefully, exactly. Reproducing the stream of counsciousness
	with no filters, awake like in Ulysses or in a dream, asleep like in Finnegans Wake.
	</p>
	<p>Then comes my clever older brother. Although he was the last child in his own family. Ludwig Wittgenstein.
	He started by looking for the code associated to each word, the facts associated to each sentences. He journeyed
	to find that the meaning of each words is their use in the language. Multiplicity then, depending on the context.
	The meaning of "meaning" then is its use in the language and so is the meaning of "use".
	</p>
	<p>Frederic Chopin unveiled for us a complete world, with luminous spaces and dark corners. Meaning then ceases
	to be needed as we find ourselves into the right places where mind and feelings, bodies and emotions are not
	separated. But to understand that this could be allowed one had to wait for the interpretation of Byron Janis.
	Wonderful man that can detach each note to better bring it to fullfill the purpose of the piece. Full. Feel.
	<p>
	Anne-Sophie Mutter, the amazon. Especially when she plays modern. Mutter modern. There she associates with Bela Bartok,
	rooting himself in ethnic "simplicity" to rise in abstract volutes that catch a ray of sun, or with Sofia Gubaidulina
	to express the latter sense of "re-ligio" that she defines as "re-legato or as the 
	restoration of the connection between oneself and the Absolute". Absolute, definitely not in words. Although Cynthia Fleury in her 
	extraordinary Ph.D thesis, "Métaphysique de l'imagination", attempts to lift the veil of the orientation "to be" may suggest on the path of one's life. 
	We shall always be "to be or not to be". Isn't this what Frank Zappa tried to express with his incredibly rich and complex musical compositions?
	Over the years I have always come back to it, appreciating ever more the intricacies of the sounds and the rythms, the humor that jumps
	at you at every corner, the life finally that exhale from it. Merleau-Ponty philosophy has recently be shown it can serve as a philosophical foundation for quantum mechanics 
        that does not lead to inherent contadictions. If understand Merleau-Ponty's philosophy rightly he insists 
	that whatever we do, think or speak about, it should always been kept in mind that everything is based on perception; 
	this is precisely this location where to be or not to be can't help but mirror each other, the chiasm, as he defines it. As I read
	some of his writings, I am always puzzled by the fact that things are expressed in words and sentences, and thus do not, as the rest,
	have any exemption regarding the fact that they to are relative to the perceptual step they were derived from. And this is valid
	for what I am currently saying. If one follows Merleau-Ponty's philosophy one should thus always remind ourselves of this. As a matter
	of fact, in his small but very dense book "L'œil et l'esprit" (The eye and the spirit), he advocates that modern painters, starting with
	Cézanne, go far beyond than expressing an "idea" in their painting. It is a process that goes through their body, through their hands.
	Likewise what is express on the canvas is a better rendition of what is happening at the juncture between the inner and the outside world.
        It is closer to perception. It is my feeling that the musical compostions of Frank Zappa do just that in music. Its flows, its 
	complex rythms, and variations let us travel beyond precise ideas or the depiction of a specific world, even if imaginative. In it one can
	constantly explore new corners, go back and forth, with no real sense that it will lead us to a specific location or a particular meaning.
	One must remain open to the exploration that perception affords us. Somehow we must be atuned to our inner instrument.
       <p>
       To espouse rather than define, this is Anne Akiko Meyers. She is to the violin what Byron Janis is to the piano. Instrument herself. In motion.
       What else can('t) we be?
